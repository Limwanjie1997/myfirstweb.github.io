    <p><b>Synopsis</b></p>
    <p> Featuring my favourite attraction from all my travel experiences: The Cingjing Farm! This is a sheep farm in the high mountains near the city Taichung. Over here, you will be standing at more than 2000m above the sea level and be surrounded by the many mountains and even clouds. You get to take a stroll among the sheeps that will be excitedly waiting for you to feed them. You get to enjoy the cool breeze of being so high up in the mountains, as you walk on a sky boardwalk. You get to watch an exciting horseriding performance. And you get to just enjoy authentic farm chicken. It may not have a whole list of things to do, but being here will surely comfort your soul as you bask in the beautiful scenery and cool winds. I would say, it is an one-day attraction but one that you cannot miss when you come to Taiwan! If you are heading to the city Taichung, you would might as well head over here for a day or so, as this farm is just an three-hour ride away from the city centre. Follow me as I bring you through some photos and information about this sheep farm :) </p>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">What I Like</h3>
    <p><b>1. Greenery</b></p>
    <p><img src="greenery.jpg" width="500" height= "300" class="center"><img src="flowers.jpg" width="500" height= "300" class="center"></p>
    <p> Look behind me in the photo! The lush greenery is simply one of the reasons why I like to walk around in this farm. As a tourist from the super modern Singapore, it is rare to find somewhere that has greenery everywhere and has simply no tall buildings or skyscrapers to obstruct you from nature. It is nice to just look around and look up and just see greenery, blue skies and clouds! If you are a nature lover, you will love this lush greenery as much as I do too :) </p>
    <p><b>2. Walking among the mountains</b></p>
    <p><img src="sky boardwalk.jpg" width="500" height="300" class="center"><img src="sky boardwalk two.jpg" width="500" height="300" class="center"></p>
    <p>I also love walking on the sky boardwalk! This boardwalk is built in recent years and it is meant for tourists to take a stroll along it while snapping shots of the surrounding mountains. I especially enjoy this part, as it's as if I am walking among the mountains and it is really a surrounding feel that just keeps you within the sight of these mountains and immerse you in the scenery. The cool winds and the feeling of standing at an altitude more than 2000m above sea level also makes me feel super awestruck and I am sure you will too! </p>
    <p><b>3. Feeding the Sheep</b></p>
    <p><img src="feeding sheep.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center"><img src="Feeding.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center">
    <p> It's also cute to see all the sheep loitering around you and when I say "all the sheep", it is really A LOT of them! You can just purchase some ingredients at the entrance and feed to these sheeps when you see them. These sheep are REALLY proactive in getting food from tourists so beware of them CHARGING at you!! But of course, they are just cute animals wanting food and it is still a lovely experience feeding these sheep :) </p>
    <p><b>4.Horseback Show</b></p>
    <p><img src="horseback show.jpg" width="500" height="300" class="center">
    <p>And a not-so-known part of this farm attraction is the horseriding show!! It is really exciting to watch them perform those amazing stunts with the horse and the pure chemistry between the horses and the performers, the performers' flexibility and the great stunts and music gelled together, just keep making me awestruck! Just follow the signs to this place and you will get to watch this amazing performance :) </p>

<div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="directions">
<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Directions</h3>
<p><b>1.Book a hotel in the city Taichung ( 台中 ）</b></p>
<img src="twinstar hotel.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center"><img src="cafe.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center">
<p>Hotels in this city are pretty cheap, as compared to Taipei, so you can just head on to Expedia or Agoda to book a suitable hotel for yourself and your companions! For myself, I spent around $70 a night by sharing two rooms with my three other friends. So having stayed in the city for three nights to allow myself two full days of exploring Taichung and nearby attractions, I spent just slightly above $200! The hotel is quite okay, and there are cafes, restaurants and most importantly, night markets nearby!</p>
<p><b>2. Book a driver to drive you up for two to three hours</b> </p>
<img src="haplay taiwan.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center"><img src="road trip.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center">
<p>You can book a driver with one of the established tour companies in Taiwan! One example will be Haplay Taiwan. Based on my experience, the service of the drivers is pretty good, as they are experienced and friendly :) The price is a bit high , but still within the affordable range. You can book the driver for half day, one full day, two full days or even longer. I would recommend booking a driver for two full days and get him or her to bring you to Cingjing Farm and Sun Moon Lake on Day 1 and other small attractions on Day 2! Just a warm reminder, most good attractions are outside the city area so don't scrimp and just book a driver already!</p>
<p><b>3. Buy a ticket and get a map!</b></p>
<img src="farm entrance.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center"><img src="cingjing map.jpg" width="500" height="350" class="center">
<p> Upon reaching the entrance, you can buy a ticket for NT$160 or NT$200 depending on the season. Before entering, just remember to get the map and follow the map to the few different attractions in the farm. Although the farm isn't very big, it will still be good to follow the map so that you can visit everything and get the most out of the ticket!</p>
